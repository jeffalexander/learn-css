1. Installing on the mac was easier than I remember.
	* Follow the readme to just move the stubs out of the way. Then you don't have to mod your PATH.

1. Consider implementations of git commit procedures and strategies:
	
	* Initialize a 'develop' branch for continuous integrations of project parts and features.
	* Include documentation for commit and branch procedures as reference.
	* Consider Versioning conventions for tagging milestone commit histories.
