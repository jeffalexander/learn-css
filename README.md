Learning CSS
I have heard that CSS is a mileage language. You have to put in the miles to really understand it.

Specific goals
1. Learn CSS
	1. Current day with a slight lense of the 'whys-the-old-css-hack-exists' of the past
2. Learn git / github
3. Learn Markdown

Bonus goals
1. Chrome dev tools workspace
2. Chrome dev tools CSS debugging
3. Chrome dev tools CSS performance tuning

Learning strategy
1. Commit often
2. Code examples when going through tutorials - stop just reading about it
3. How to view code samples on many browsers?

Resources
1. CSS: The Definitive Guide, 3rd Edition
	1. This book is from 2006. Need something newer too.
2. CSS Grid Layout
