# Learning CSS
I have heard that **CSS is a mileage language**. To be proficient, you have to put in the miles so you can really understand it.

## Specific goals
1. Learn CSS
	1. Current day with a slight lense of 'why-the-old-css-hacks-exist'
1. Learn git / github
1. Learn Markdown

## Bonus goals
1.	Chrome dev tools 
	1.	workspace
	1.	CSS debugging
	1.	CSS performance tuning
1. Tools
	1. Markdown: 
		1. LightPaper
		1. Mou (slow to save files)

## Learning strategy
1. Commit often
1. Code examples when going through tutorials
	- stop just reading about it
1. How to view code samples on many browsers?
1. Put lessons in comments using tags in CAPS
	- LESSON: something learned
	- GOTCHA: annoying thing that is un-expected
	- TODO: more coding to do
